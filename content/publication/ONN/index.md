abstract: To alleviate the computational demands of deep neural networks, network pruning is widely adopted. However, its application to diverse hardware often necessitates costly fine-tuning, making it impractical. Alternatively, multi-network training methods have emerged, optimizing a neural network alongside its sub-networks, enabling adaptation to various computational constraints without extensive fine-tuning. However, existing approaches inherit canonical training designs that sub-optimally handle interference in multi-network training. In this paper, we present Onionization, a systematic multi-network training approach that extends existing works with vast design enhancement spanning across sub-network construction, gradient calculation, parameter update, and training schedule. Through evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we showcase the notable superiority of our method over existing techniques on well-known network architectures like ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet.
